This application is to be used for the final project of the class CIS355 Summer 2017. It has the ability to create,
read, update, and delete three different tables. Those tables are tt_persons,tt_courses,tt_rounds with tt_rounds being
a junction table. This application will also allow a user to register for an account and then login/logout of said 
account. From the homepage(after login) the user will be able to select between the headers Players,Courses,Rounds in 
order to view the 3-table crud, or one of the buttons provided below. The three buttons will do three different tasks,
Logout: will log the user out of the current account, JSON File: will show the user a given json file, Upload File:
will allow the user to upload a file of their choice and then be told file type, size, and name. Diagrams have been 
provided a ER Diagram to show relationships of the 3 tables, process flow to give an idea of how the code is operating,
use case which has 5 cases of the application, then a screen flow to give an idea of the layout of the website.
